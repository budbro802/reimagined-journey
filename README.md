# reimagined-journey
This is a repository of all my projects - Notably my first from FrontEnd Mentor
This is also my very first repository in GitHub.
Additionally, I'm still in the learning stages of my HTML/CSS/SASS journey. I'm working toward becoming a developer - Starting in the front-end space.
I am a customer support specialist (Glorified product support) at a software company.
Hopefully, everyone (or anyone) who comes across this shows me grace as this is the very beginning.
Cheers!
